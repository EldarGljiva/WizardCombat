## Welcome to Wizard's Duel!

Wizard Combat is a small project that I created using JavaScript to test and apply my knowledge of the language. In this project, I focused on the behavior of the app, prioritizing functionality over design. 

This project allows you to experience a magical duel against Merlin, the Male Wizard. It's an interactive game that challenges your reflexes and quick decision-making. In this duel, one key, 'A,' randomly appears on the screen out of several others, representing your attack. Timing is crucial; pressing the 'A' key on time deals damage to Merlin and continues until you achieve victory.

## Game Instructions

- You are a wizard facing off against Merlin.
- Your goal is to defeat Merlin, but be cautious!
- If your health reaches 0, you'll be defeated.

To emerge victorious:

1. Press the 'A' key when it appears on the screen within one second.
2. Successfully hitting the 'A' key will deal 2 damage to Merlin, bringing you closer to victory.
3. If Merlin's health reaches 0, you are the winner.
4. However, if you miss, you'll lose 2 HP.

May the mightiest wizard claim victory!

## What I've Learned

Throughout the development of this project, I enriched my JavaScript knowledge by reading online documentation and experimenting to bring the game to life as I imagined. It was a valuable experience that allowed me to improve my coding skills and create an engaging interactive game. Importantly, I challenged myself by not using any frameworks like jQuery; instead, I wanted to test my ability to achieve the app's behavior using pure JavaScript.
